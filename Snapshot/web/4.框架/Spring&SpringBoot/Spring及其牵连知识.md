## REST

* **Representational**—REST resources can be represented in virtually any form,
  including XML, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or even HTML—whatever
  form best suits the consumer of those resources.

* **State**—When working with REST, you’re more concerned with the state of a
  resource than with the actions you can take against resources.

* **Transfer**—REST involves transferring resource data, in some representational 

  form, from one application to another.
